These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of \r\nenthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, \r\nor because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, \r\nbut they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, \r\nforearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different \r\nways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the \r\nWeight Lifting Exercise Dataset).   \r\n\r\nThe goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. \r\nThis is the \"classe\" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. \r\nYou should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, \r\nwhat you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. \r\nYou will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.  \r\n\r\n### Results\r\nPlease see this page: [http://http://romkhot.github.io/Coursera-Machine-Learning-CP/](http://romkhot.github.io/Coursera-Machine-Learning-CP/)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
